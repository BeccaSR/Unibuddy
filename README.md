# Unibuddy
A python programme designed to help new starters to university.

This programme was made following my second week on the HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp. The project was designed to practice and highlight the python skills learnt so far, including:
- gathering and displaying user data using input and print functions
- implementing decision-making constructs and control structures (while loops, for loops and if-elif-else statements)
- conducting basic arithmetic operations and logical comparisons
- creating a practical application of these skills, by crafting personalised responses and suggestions based off user input


Case Study Story:

Imagine the first day of university for a freshman named Alex. 
Alex is excited but also overwhelmed by the vast campus, numerous courses, and the sea of new faces. 
To aid new students like Alex, the university's IT department has developed a personalised chatbot. 
This chatbot, named "UniBuddy", is designed to make the transition smoother for freshmen.
Upon accessing the chatbot, Alex is prompted to enter their name, favourite colour, and age. 
Based on this input, UniBuddy offers a personalised greeting.
For instance, if Alex's favourite colour is blue, UniBuddy might suggest joining the university's "Blue Art Club".
If Alex is 18, the chatbot might provide information about freshman-specific events.
The chatbot also offers a feature where Alex can input specific queries, like "Where is the library?" or "How do I join the debate club?", 
    and UniBuddy responds with relevant information, all while adhering to a friendly tone,
    using string transformation methods to ensure the responses feel personalised and engaging.
